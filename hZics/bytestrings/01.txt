Similarly, we believe that organic social growth is the key to a project that lasts. We\u2019re not rushing to mint, and we\u2019re not using any flash-in-the-pan marketing tactics.&nbsp; Dead Rabbits were conceived from the beginning to stand the test of time.\n\n\t{image 30}\nJEB TESSERACTJeb loves ideas.

You can buy ADA at pretty much any crypto exchange. If you\u2019re in the US, Coinbase Pro is one good option. \nThen you\u2019ll need to send your ADA from the exchange to your Nami or CCV (Eternl) wallet. To mint a Dead Rabbit, you must have one of these two wallets!&nbsp; They take only a few seconds to install.&nbsp; This is because the DRRS mint is a true multi-sig mint, which is faster and safer for you, the buyer.&nbsp; If you send ADA after we sell out, or send incorrect ADA, you will not need to wait to get your refund, it happens instantaneously.\nYour Dead Rabbit NFT will be sent to the ADA wallet used to purchase. You can then use pool.pm to view your NFT. Never buy NFTs by sending crypto directly from an exchange!&nbsp; (Most exchange wallets cannot receive the NFT you have purchased.)\n\nThere\u2019s a treasure hunt?Yes. The Hunt for the Rabbit Ronin goes live the instant we mint the collection. Some Dead Rabbit NFTs contain a clue, and there are 10 clues total. When all 10 are solved, they reveal a secret that allows the solver to redeem the treasure once we hit the 50% sell-through target in our roadmap. The treasure is 1 ultra-rare Alien Rabbit God NFT + 5000 ADA.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Day of the Rabbit Supreme?Once announced, the first 333 unique addresses to send exactly two Dead Rabbits to a special address, during a set 24-hour period, will receive one Rabbit Supreme. Rabbits Supreme are a little different and have a much better chance to contain rare items. Only 333 Rabbits Supreme will ever be minted. All Dead Rabbits exchanged for Rabbits Supreme will be burned, never to be spoken of again.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Dead Event?\nThe Dead Event is something new in the NFT space.&nbsp; It\u2019s an IRL and online adventure with prizes for Dead Rabbit holders.&nbsp; Read more about it here.\nWhat are Alien Rabbit Gods?\nThese are ultra-rare 1\/1 Dead Rabbits.&nbsp; Only 6 will ever be minted.\nAny Dead Rabbits withheld from the sale?50 Dead Rabbits will be used as prizes. 4 will be used by team members for the hard rabbit flex.\n\n\n\n\tJOIN OUR DISCORD\nWin WL and Dead Rabbit NFTs.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n","content_partial_html":"\n\t<b>\n\n<br><\/b><br><br><br><br><h1>It was a bright day in April <br>\nwhen Wilhelm Tesseract discovered <br>\nhe could jump through time. <br>\n<br>The year was 2097.<\/h1><br>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #038eff;\">THE DAY OF THE RABBIT SUPREME IS NOW LIVE!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nVISIT OUR MINT WEBSITE TO MINT YOUR SUPREME\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/deadrabbits.secretgoats.io\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #f60;\"><span style=\"color: #f60;\"><span style=\"color: #f60;\">https:\/\/deadrabbits.secretgoats.io\/<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><\/span><\/h2>\n\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #484848;\"><b><span style=\"color: #484848;\">Scroll down<\/span>\n<br>\n\n\ue08c\ufe0e<\/b><\/span><br>\n<br>\n<img width=\"2200\" height=\"2200\" width_o=\"2200\" height_o=\"2200\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/5a0783e28cbcfba5d3c79164af0eba09eea38ae65b9a2e33cb40f749e9a9db6f\/Sold-out.png\" data-mid=\"140482466\" border=\"0\" data-scale=\"75\"\/><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2>DEAD RABBITS AVAILABLE NOW ON <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpg.store\/collection\/deadrabbitresurrectionsociety\" target=\"_blank\">JPG.STORE<\/a><br><\/h2>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n\t\n<img width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\" width_o=\"2048\" height_o=\"2048\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/d81895a711cb7f874df464790c15d79cdd4505110e9811bf313bed4acf2acca4\/4k_MASTER.png\" data-mid=\"133876423\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"819\" height=\"819\" width_o=\"819\" height_o=\"819\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/8d90f3f652843519c8eb23e763d72e26d1e12c878dd8359dd57ba473b2183529\/5.png\" data-mid=\"133850249\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\" width_o=\"2048\" height_o=\"2048\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/ea33db77411bb25ccaa119f7b7fafff941d072c414b3301a66f09c6c64959cfa\/6.png\" data-mid=\"133988037\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\" width_o=\"2048\" height_o=\"2048\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/bb384a27726f0655190a5a5dd4513853fae92ed3c3d94e714c1106c873a7daab\/8.png\" data-mid=\"134575660\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"819\" height=\"819\" width_o=\"819\" height_o=\"819\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/8a07a4fd30ed5d745ed7fc92bc76c03c9dec031ad75102ec21af26f4bbd5ad3f\/30.png\" data-mid=\"133877103\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\" width_o=\"2048\" height_o=\"2048\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/4b004cca23cf667a391e86147eb822fa4a422f644a439304f2a149a1cec95a83\/3.png\" data-mid=\"133988034\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"819\" height=\"819\" width_o=\"819\" height_o=\"819\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/4642697eb36bc85460bb7f3ffd37ed360efb5907ef1ce68b259fec0736ccf81c\/8.png\" data-mid=\"133848489\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"819\" height=\"819\" width_o=\"819\" height_o=\"819\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/52b17fbd30359afcada9f913c50541899d1dc4ec27e8a72f215aee33b419e6c1\/11.png\" data-mid=\"133848511\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"819\" height=\"819\" width_o=\"819\" height_o=\"819\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/2a00692b5d2d2a6cadf11b0f4c5c5b16499f27e507692d997b40361df0dddebf\/14.png\" data-mid=\"133876945\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"819\" height=\"819\" width_o=\"819\" height_o=\"819\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/7b95e3fab768101cb432c478a61478b1c461c10c5ba30230f3fa3f422b52105c\/9.png\" data-mid=\"133850253\" border=\"0\" \/>\n<img width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\" width_o=\"2048\" height_o=\"2048\" data-src=\"https:\/\/freight.cargo.site\/t\/original\/i\/a4407deeb7c77d22f044acda08c3152ad128c46ac845dc1540aa5d14ee0833bf\/2.png\" data-mid=\"133988033\" border=\"0\" \/>\n\n\t<h2>DEAD RABBIT<br>\nRESURRECTION SOCIETY<\/h2><hr>Our clan have always been scavengers.&nbsp;

You can buy ADA at pretty much any crypto exchange. If you\u2019re in the US, <a href=\"http:\/\/pro.coinbase.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coinbase Pro<\/a> is one good option. <br><br>\nThen you\u2019ll need to send your ADA from the exchange to your <a href=\"https:\/\/namiwallet.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nami<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/eternl.io\/app\/mainnet\/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">CCV<\/a> (Eternl) wallet. To mint a Dead Rabbit, you must have one of these two wallets!&nbsp; They take only a few seconds to install.&nbsp; This is because the DRRS mint is a true multi-sig mint, which is faster and safer for you, the buyer.&nbsp; If you send ADA after we sell out, or send incorrect ADA, you will not need to wait to get your refund, it happens instantaneously.<br><br>\nYour Dead Rabbit NFT will be sent to the ADA wallet used to purchase. You can then use <a href=\"https:\/\/pool.pm\/tokens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pool.pm<\/a> to view your NFT. Never buy NFTs by sending crypto directly from an exchange!&nbsp; (Most exchange wallets cannot receive the NFT you have purchased.)<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: rgba(255, 85, 0, 0.95);\"><b>There\u2019s a treasure hunt?<\/b><\/span>Yes.

Who controls the present controls the past. <\/i><br><br>\nBernal staggered down the low tunnel, smearing blood along the rough rock at intervals as he leaned on the wall. <br><br>\nHis right eye was ruined, pulped by the butt of a Mole carbine\u2014it would need to be replaced. His right shoulder was torn open. But the slit in his SpecOps cloak did not match the jagged lacerations in his flesh. A Mole arcblade had sliced cleanly through the secsteel fibers; the wound itself Bernal had inflicted when he ripped out the gimpbolt. They would not take him down to Mole Town, not this time, not so easily. <br><br>\nFinally, he reached the end of the tunnel, set with a heavy steel door. Bernal keyed in his code, and slumped inside. <br><br>\nReception was empty, but he heard voices in the Staging Room and made his way toward the sound. <br><br>\nThey were gathered about the briefing table, many members of the Conclave and a handful of Supremes, standing. Some looked angry, others worried. One spotted him and coughed. Torsten Tesseract, head of the Conclave, swept a sheaf of papers from the table and rolled them up before Bernal could catch a good look. They were yellowed, aged, even through the pain he saw that much, and they had a musty smell. <br><br>\n\u201c237,\u201d Torsten said. \u201cYou look terrible. Glad you\u2019re alive, we\u2019ve had our doubts. Let\u2019s get you patched up.\u201d <br><br>\nThey led him down to the medbay. Bright lights and a dull blue operating table. A spot of red appeared on the floor, and another, he blinked dumbly, not registering what they were or where they came from. He felt the sting of a needle and slipped into darkness.<br><br>\n***<br>\n<br>\nHe awoke sitting upright in an elevated bed. His head hurt, but his vision was clear. Startlingly so. He could not, in fact, remember ever having seen so clearly in his life. He watched particles of dust flow on the channels of his breath, parting to pass around the chair, as water in a river parts to pass around stones. His eye came to rest on the crossbar at the foot of his bed. He zoomed in until he saw imperfections in the metal, tiny dark pockmarks in the chrome. With a start he zoomed out, too fast, and the change brought a sickness to his stomach. <br><br>\nTorsten Tesseract cleared his throat from the corner. \u201cYou\u2019re not all rabbit anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cYamarashi did that work himself, and from the look of you, it seems to function well.\u201d<br><br>\n Bernal nodded, remembering, and scanned the walls for a mirror. No luck. <br><br>\n\u201cMaybe best to wait on that for a bit,\u201d Torsten said. \u201cLet it heal. In the meantime, we have plenty to talk about. You\u2019ve been gone awhile. What happened out there?\u201d <br><br>\nBernal sucked in a breath. \u201cMoles. Ambushed us in Istanbul, 1890. Earlier than they\u2019ve ever been aggressive. Waiting for us in the tunnels, it was strange. They didn\u2019t have modern gear\u2014their equipment was vintage\u2014but it was cobbled together in a modern way. They had a functional radio. 5 years before radio was operational. And a seriously upgraded machine gun compared to anything available back then. I swear one had a makeshift darkscreen. It didn't work, from what I could tell anyway, but he must have had access to schematics. I'm not saying they can timejump. Yet. But I think they've figured a way to communicate through time.\u201d <br>\n<br>Torsten squinted. \u201cWho busted up your eye?\u201d <br><br>\n\u201cThese 1890\u2019s Moles weren\u2019t just singers,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cThey had Grunts too. No Molechoir this trip, just shooting and bashing. Something has changed.\u201d <br><br>\nTorsten drew a recpad from his pocket. \u201cWe knew it was bad when Tialoc spoke, two nights ago. Here's what he had to say.\"<br>\n<br>The leader of the Conclave held up the device and tapped play. The deep voice of Tialoc Tesseract filled the little room. <br><br>\n\u201cSomething seethes beneath us, comrades. A long-fingered darkness reaches up to the Warrens. Gather your breath, and the spoils of your greatest jumps. Band together, scavengers. War is coming.\u201d<\/div><br>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><hr><div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"2\" grid-gutter=\"4\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"3\" grid-pad=\"2\" class=\"\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><h2>ENTRY 11<br><\/h2>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr><small>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Bernal Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">06.04.2098<\/span><\/small><\/div><\/div>\n\t<div grid-col=\"9\" grid-pad=\"2\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>Isn\u2019t there something in living dangerously?<\/i><br>\n<br>\n Bernal Tesseract sat alone in his room. On the desk his best gear was laid out before him, the spoils of 26 jumps. <br><br>\nA drip from a pipe overhead marked time like a metronome. The drip pooled in a corner, making a puddle whose size, had anyone bothered to measure it, captured the exact number of seconds elapsed since the streetside factory above engaged its nightshift water supply. The resulting trickle disappeared down a drainage grate and ran into the Wet Tunnels, where it merged in the dark with a thousand other such rivulets, a writhing river of black and uncounted hours. <br><br>\nBut Bernal could not indulge such thoughts. Not tonight. Instead, he pored over the gear on his desk, eyes bright. <br><br>\nHe had been invited to appear before the Conclave. Their number had lately decreased by one\u2014a rare incident of rockdeath due to an overambitious jump. <br><br>\nThe invitation itself was an honor, and marked him as one of the best scavengers in the clan. He had the collection to prove it. Trophies not only from the 80s and 90s, sunglasses and other souvenirs from the golden age of trifles, but an assortment of more utilitarian items from his own time as well. There was a darkscreen stolen from the Moles. A Veritas audiovid helmet with chem-detector, droid override, and IR display. And a cyborg wolf mask capable of rending iron with its adamantine teeth. <br><br>\nStill, his acceptance was not guaranteed. They would interrogate him on stealth tactics. Psi resistance. Mech, tech, and demolitions. They would quiz him with an endless series of blending questions, queries meant to gauge how well he could pass for native in the times he jumped back to. It was no good trying to infiltrate (or party with) Berlin\u2019s Skate Punk Nihilists in the 80s if you didn\u2019t know the boards, the bands, and the lingo.<br><\/div>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, they would grant him his baseline, an odd paragraph of interwoven and sometimes rhyming phrases that he would repeat at the conclusion of each jump. To ensure that his mind had not degraded. <br><br>\nIf chosen by the Conclave he would join a guild of the most respected Dead Rabbits worldwide. Those entrusted with the most difficult missions. Those privy to the most secret machinations of the clan. Their name was known by everyone. Their number was 333. <br><br>\nIf chosen by the Conclave, doors deep within the Warrens, doors dreamt about since a kit, would suddenly open to him. <br><br>\nIf chosen by the Conclave, only his closest friends would continue to call him Bernal, and only then in the soft quiet of their private gatherings. <br><br>\nThe rest would address him by his proper title.<br><br>\n Supreme 237.<br><\/div>\n<br><\/div>\n<\/div><hr><br>\n<br>\n<div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"1\" grid-gutter=\"2\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"3\" grid-pad=\"1\" class=\"\"><div style=\"text-align: left\"><h2>ENTRY 10<\/h2><\/div><div style=\"text-align: right\"><br>\n<br>\n<hr><div style=\"text-align: left\"><small>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Yamarashi Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">03.04.2098<\/span><\/small><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\t<div grid-col=\"9\" grid-pad=\"1\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>\u201cYour dreams, your feelings, the speed of your hand, the reflexive movement of your eye as it tracks a mosquito: In truth, all are chemical reactions at their root.

For those with a craniospinal jack it offers, off-the-shelf:<br>\n<br><ul><li>\nCopper conductors, for hyperfast reflexes. Conductivity: 97%\n<br><\/li><li>\nT3NEMAR3 optics. 2000x EF-4 silicone dioxide lenses, polished to within .0000002 microns.\n<br><\/li><li>\nOctapol Cables with HEX5 grounded connection points for reduced feedback, compressed surges, and force-limited earwig attacks.\n<br><\/li><li>\nVeritas Boost: Jack-fed, proprietary chemical enhancements and blood assays. <br><\/li><li>\nFull suite, Lethmite tracking software. For optimal performance, let Veritas know your location, body temperature, heart rate, dopamine saturation, galvanic skin response, audio\/visual experience, and nova habits. Cognitive mapping conveniently included.<br><\/li><\/ul><br>\nAfter three months in his workshop, Yamarashi Tesseract had completed these upgrades:<br>\n<br>\n<ul><li>\nCopper removed. Replaceable silver conductor cartridges installed throughout. Conductivity: 100%\n<br><\/li><li>\nT3NEMAR3 lenses sonically polished to within .0000000007 microns.\n<br><\/li><li>\nHand-soldered cable connection vacuum box. Fully isolated. Zero feedback, zero surges, earwig attacks impossible.<\/li><li>\nLethmite tracking software purged. Update software rerouted to external drive.<\/li><\/ul><br>\nAfter maining the modified set in nova for 72 hours, Yamarashi Tesseract discarded his pulse rifle in favor of a vibrotachi. The rifle bored him. He found the sword a more enjoyable use of his new speed. Even without his targeting alarm--the amber flash in his HUD, the warning ping--it was elementary to spot movement and calculate the angles of enemy barrels.<br><br>\nWhen bullets flew, he enjoyed simply not being there.<br>\n<br>\nAs he rose in the lists, Veritas drones began to stalk him, hovering over his battles, their camsets blinking. When he hit 200 kills without a death, Veritas upped its game. They tried to switch him off, with increasing levels of urgency, but each time it resulted only in a new line of code on the vidscreen of his connection box. Humorous.<br><br>\nWhen they found that he had taken their tech off-grid, and improved upon it, Veritas implemented a new approach. He was actively hunted by MER7 Waspsins on the ground, in the air, and under the water while in nova. Every player with an on-grid set was a danger to him.<br><br>\nSo Yamarashi made additional upgrades. He bypassed the jack-fed boost and installed direct implants to service his cerebellum and amygdala. He upgraded to pharm-grade adrenaline, GABA, and serotonin. He wired in radar\/sonar detection units and anti-firecontrol software to shut down opposing scanners and targeting. And he walked nova alone.<br><br>\nIRL, he watched his back. Veritas had an army of skinjobs tasked with collecting delinquent payments, tracking would-be hackers and after-market fences, and carrying out hits on off-grid users like himself. They effectively discouraged black label use of their products with a tracking sentinel installed deep at the heart of the motherboard. Attempts to remove it resulted in an explosion large enough to destroy the hardware and a few offending fingers.<br><br>\nYamarashi Tesseract had wired the sentinel with its own battery supply, confused it with a virus of his own design, then removed it entirely. \nHe had dropped the resulting mechanism in the hopper of a streetside trash bot and chuckled as the bot zoomed away, on its endless circuit of the city.<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"1\" grid-gutter=\"2\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"x12\" grid-pad=\"1\"><hr><\/div>\n<\/div><div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"3\" grid-gutter=\"6\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"3\" grid-pad=\"3\" class=\"\"><div style=\"text-align: left\"><h2>ENTRY 9<\/h2><\/div><div style=\"text-align: right\"><br>\n<br>\n<hr><div style=\"text-align: left\"><small>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Bernal Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">02.04.2098<\/span><\/small><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\t<div grid-col=\"9\" grid-pad=\"3\" class=\"\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>We were dead but now we are free.<\/i><br><br>\nBernal Tesseract woke to the smell of fear. <br><br>\nHe scrambled from his bedding and sprinted the low access tunnel that led to the main Warrens. In the sleeping hall all was not well. The clan\u2019s bunks and nests lay empty. Some rabbits sat on their haunches, oddly, hunkered on the stone floor, their hands clutching their heads, as though trying to ward off some terrible and invisible pain. <br><br>\nBut most of the clan stood rapt, erect, in neat lines they stood, and each line was eight rabbits long. <br><br>\nAt their head stood a labour of Moles. Eight Moles in blue black robes had arranged themselves in a semicircle, they swayed gently in and out, rocking on their heels and murmuring in atonal unison. <br><br>\nTheir darkscreens pulsed with sluggish ivory light that bathed the Warrens in a fractured, rhythmic flash. Bernal yawned. The smell of fear hung heavy all around him but this no longer struck him as important.<br><br>\nIn the molesong he caught a glimpse of an underground tower, earthworks plunging boldly down into the dark, the masterwork of a great race, a place of nobility, a place full of secrets. It was a place he should like to visit, Bernal thought. Endless interweaving tunnels, glowing with grublight, caverns ringing with dirgesong, melancholy yes, but also beautiful, and far from the sharp intruding sun. An orderly place, where an honest rabbit could work hard for a sure meal and a dry place to sleep. <br><br>\nBernal paused in his reverie, for this last thought took him aback. It seemed overwrought. Food came easy to his clan. The Dead Warrens were an excellent place to sleep. And of the rabbits he knew, most were wily, all were skilled, and none were overfond of work. He opened his eyes. <br>\n<br>\nA column of 24 rabbits, walking three abreast, were being led out of the sleeping hall by three Moles. The other five wandered among the stragglers, rabbits like himself who had not moved in response to the summons. One approached him, its darkscreen flashed white and Bernal felt a sizzling pain behind his eyes.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cFall in, worker.\u201d The Mole\u2019s voice was in his head. Bernal took a staggering step forward and stopped. He opened his mouth to cry out, to rally his clan, but a bright flash from the darkscreen and a sudden surge of pain silenced him.<br><br>\n\u201cTry that again and I\u2019ll fry you,\u201d the Mole said. \u201cNow fall in.\u201d<br><br>\nBernal gritted his teeth and refused to move. The Mole reached to adjust a dial on his darkscreen, but at that moment a dull yellow light spilled from the archway that led down into the Deep Warrens.<br><br>\nThe Mole hissed, and his clan mates in the hall scurried to his side. The three Moles leading the column rushed back in to join their fellows. They formed a semicircle, their robes swayed about their feet as they rocked in and out. Each turned a dial on his darkscreen, a piercing electric hum filled the hall, and once again they intoned the molesong, waiting. They did not wait long. <br><br>\nA huge green rabbit framed the archway, clad in scavenger armor, a pulse rifle slung across his back. He stared at the Moles from behind the glowing yellow optics of his rebreather helmet and stood his ground. The song of the Moles took on the pitch of an ululating shriek, their darkscreens flashed with white heat, and the psiwave they sent out before them was a visible violet net that crackled in the air.<br>\n<br>\nThe net never reached him. It erupted in a hail of sparks, its wasted energy outlining a perfect sphere of empty space that extended for a meter in all directions around the rabbit.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDanger!\u201d shrieked the Moles. \u201cHe\u2019s psi-shielded! Retreat!\u201d <br><br>\nBut it was too late for that. The rabbit touched a switch on his helmet and with an electric snap all eight darkscreens flashed searing white for an instant, and burned out. The Moles fell to the ground, writhing, and then went still.<br><br>\n\u201cCast their bodies down into the grub tunnel,\u201d the green rabbit said. \u201cI think the Moles will not bother us for some time.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nWith that he turned back to the Deep Warrens, his pulse rifle still slung over his shoulder, untouched. The clan gathered together.<br><br>\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d the young ones wanted to know. <br><br>\nBernal Tesseract smiled.<br>\n<br>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cwas Salnar Tesseract.\u201d&nbsp;<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"3\" grid-gutter=\"6\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"x12\" grid-pad=\"3\"><hr><\/div>\n<\/div><div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"3\" grid-gutter=\"6\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"3\" grid-pad=\"3\"><div style=\"text-align: left\"><h2>ENTRY 8<\/h2><\/div><div style=\"text-align: right\"><br>\n<br>\n<hr><div style=\"text-align: left\"><small>FROM THE <br>\nRECORDINGS OF:\n<br>\n<b>Alma Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.23.2098<\/span><\/small><\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t<div grid-col=\"9\" grid-pad=\"3\" class=\"\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Alma Tesseract leapt backward in the dark. Upon landing her heel struck a stone and she stumbled to the ground. Her hand flashed to her temple and her vizhelm crackled on.<br>\n<br>\n Three Moles loomed over her. How they got so close, and so quickly, without making a sound, she could not fathom. But there they were, swaying together in silent uncertain synchrony, their snouts in the air, sniffing.<br>\n<br>\n All three had darkscreens, implants, expensive. They wore robes of the same blue black color as their fur and none seemed to carry a weapon. The center Mole stiffened and stared down at her. A faint light flickered within the obsidian depth of his darkscreen, for an instant Alma thought she saw two white and wizened eyes. A shudder passed through the Mole, ripples ran down his snout.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cTime-hopper,\u201d he hissed. \u201cYour thoughts reveal your intent. But indeed we are armed, as you shall soon find out.\u201d He drew himself up and his companions leaned in, as though harmonizing.<br>\n<br>\n The psiwave hit her like a thunderclap. It surged out from the Moles unchecked and Alma found herself again in the dark, sound surrounded her like the rush of the ocean, her ears filled with it, and somewhere in that dizzy rumble hung a trace of song, a sleepy familiar song that her mother used to hum.<br>\n<br>\n Alma woke on her side. Her vizhelm had been removed. The Moles whispered to each other as they rifled through her pack.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cOld. Old. Old.\u201d one of them said.<br>\n<br>\n Alma heard the sounds of her gear being tossed aside.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cAh, but here\u2019s a medscan, save that.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n Soon enough they were finished. Alma\u2019s mind had cleared considerably, the muscles in her legs twitched and she felt her sense of balance return.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cPut these on her,\u201d the lead Mole said, taking something from his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring this one before the labour.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n Alma did not wait to find out what that meant. She bolted down the pitch dark tunnel, the Moles cried out behind her in dismay. She did not turn back. She rushed into the grublight and found her winch hanging where she left it. She snapped it to her belt, eyes straining down the tunnel for any sign of movement, and ascended through the hatchway. She slammed shut the hatch. It was dark, but familiar smells were all around. The Warrens were close.<br>\n<br>\nAlma put her arms out before her and groped her way along until at last the faint orange glow of the outer maintenance LEDs began to light her path. She exhaled.<br>\n<br>\n Her thoughts had turned to her report, and to the questions of the clan, when suddenly a Mole voice, thick with anger, hissed deep within her mind:<br>\n<br>\n \u201cGoodbye, time-hopper.

Alma Tesseract ran her knife around the rim and struck the center with a length of rebar scrap. She cringed at the sound, a muted metallic clank that quickly faded.<br>\n<br>\n She was deep beneath the Warrens. Maintenance crawlways, drainage tubes, and air vents crisscrossed the rock, but even at this depth larger tunnels were still being discovered.<br>\n<br>\n With effort she freed the hatch and swung it open. Immediately her vizhelm registered a light source, she flicked off the IR broadcast in her HUD and waited for her eyes to adjust. Phosphorescence spilled from the hatchway, a cobalt green that made her think of blacklight.<br>\n<br>\n She fixed her grapmag to an iron girder and lowered herself into the tunnel. It was full-sized, 4 meters of line unwound to reach the base. Alma unclipped the winch from her belt and left it hanging.<br>\n<br>\n Faint light surrounded her. She guessed lichen would be the source, or a deep-dwelling fungus, but the light shifted somewhat, pulsated, and when she knelt for a closer look she saw that it came from grubs. Thousands of luminescent grubs meandered along the walls, feeding on regular streaks of what looked to be heavy black paste.<br>\n<br>\n There were no train tracks in the tunnel, which was odd. Alma enabled mapping and continued on. There was an acrid smell, not rot exactly, but sour. She much preferred the dry, old smell of the Warrens.<br>\n<br>\n After a time the paste on the walls disappeared, the grubs thinned out and the light dimmed. Alma tread on quietly, her eyes had adjusted and she did not want to spoil the walk with the HUD. But as she ventured further the dark in the tunnel became thick. Her breathing went shallow, she felt pressed in upon, and even her rabbit eyes could see nothing.<br>\n<br>\n Just at that time she entered a place of dangerous silence, a watchful quiet, that is the sound of several quiets overlapping.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re in Mole Land,\u201d said a gravely voice. \u201cAnd should not be.\u201d<br><br>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"3\" grid-gutter=\"6\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"x12\" grid-pad=\"3\"><hr><\/div>\n<\/div><div grid-row=\"\" grid-pad=\"3\" grid-gutter=\"6\" grid-responsive=\"\">\n\t<div grid-col=\"3\" grid-pad=\"3\" class=\"\"><div style=\"text-align: right\"><div style=\"text-align: left\"><h2>ENTRY 6<\/h2><\/div><br>\n<br>\n<hr><div style=\"text-align: left\"><small>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Rhosgobel Tesseract<\/b>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.13.2098<\/span><\/small><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\t<div grid-col=\"9\" grid-pad=\"3\" class=\"\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>There are times when the air that floats between mortals becomes, in its stillness and silence, as cruel as the edge of a scythe.<\/i><br>\n<br>\n Nova changes you.

It was old, circa 2050s, manufactured during a period when the retro green of the MS-DOS display had come back into vogue.<br>\n<br>\n It flashed the same code at him in rotation, maddeningly, again and again, across its curved monitor. It looked like M1T7R1Lhex, a basic security language that every rabbit learned as a kit. But each attempt he made to crack it from that framework failed\u2026and he was getting cold.<br>\n<br>\n Beyond the locked door somewhere, his Berliner comrades were holed up in warm tunnels, jacked into nova or gathered around a fire barrel, chewing braided grass.<br>\n<br>\n He had begun to shiver, and to give up hope of breaking the entrance code.

Who controls the present controls the past. \nBernal staggered down the low tunnel, smearing blood along the rough rock at intervals as he leaned on the wall. \nHis right eye was ruined, pulped by the butt of a Mole carbine\u2014it would need to be replaced. His right shoulder was torn open. But the slit in his SpecOps cloak did not match the jagged lacerations in his flesh. A Mole arcblade had sliced cleanly through the secsteel fibers; the wound itself Bernal had inflicted when he ripped out the gimpbolt. They would not take him down to Mole Town, not this time, not so easily. \nFinally, he reached the end of the tunnel, set with a heavy steel door. Bernal keyed in his code, and slumped inside. \nReception was empty, but he heard voices in the Staging Room and made his way toward the sound. \nThey were gathered about the briefing table, many members of the Conclave and a handful of Supremes, standing. Some looked angry, others worried. One spotted him and coughed. Torsten Tesseract, head of the Conclave, swept a sheaf of papers from the table and rolled them up before Bernal could catch a good look. They were yellowed, aged, even through the pain he saw that much, and they had a musty smell. \n\u201c237,\u201d Torsten said. \u201cYou look terrible. Glad you\u2019re alive, we\u2019ve had our doubts. Let\u2019s get you patched up.\u201d \nThey led him down to the medbay. Bright lights and a dull blue operating table. A spot of red appeared on the floor, and another, he blinked dumbly, not registering what they were or where they came from. He felt the sting of a needle and slipped into darkness.\n***\n\nHe awoke sitting upright in an elevated bed. His head hurt, but his vision was clear. Startlingly so. He could not, in fact, remember ever having seen so clearly in his life. He watched particles of dust flow on the channels of his breath, parting to pass around the chair, as water in a river parts to pass around stones. His eye came to rest on the crossbar at the foot of his bed. He zoomed in until he saw imperfections in the metal, tiny dark pockmarks in the chrome. With a start he zoomed out, too fast, and the change brought a sickness to his stomach. \nTorsten Tesseract cleared his throat from the corner. \u201cYou\u2019re not all rabbit anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cYamarashi did that work himself, and from the look of you, it seems to function well.\u201d\n Bernal nodded, remembering, and scanned the walls for a mirror. No luck. \n\u201cMaybe best to wait on that for a bit,\u201d Torsten said. \u201cLet it heal. In the meantime, we have plenty to talk about. You\u2019ve been gone awhile. What happened out there?\u201d \nBernal sucked in a breath. \u201cMoles. Ambushed us in Istanbul, 1890. Earlier than they\u2019ve ever been aggressive. Waiting for us in the tunnels, it was strange. They didn\u2019t have modern gear\u2014their equipment was vintage\u2014but it was cobbled together in a modern way. They had a functional radio. 5 years before radio was operational. And a seriously upgraded machine gun compared to anything available back then. I swear one had a makeshift darkscreen. It didn't work, from what I could tell anyway, but he must have had access to schematics. I'm not saying they can timejump. Yet. But I think they've figured a way to communicate through time.\u201d \nTorsten squinted. \u201cWho busted up your eye?\u201d \n\u201cThese 1890\u2019s Moles weren\u2019t just singers,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cThey had Grunts too. No Molechoir this trip, just shooting and bashing. Something has changed.\u201d \nTorsten drew a recpad from his pocket. \u201cWe knew it was bad when Tialoc spoke, two nights ago. Here's what he had to say.\"\nThe leader of the Conclave held up the device and tapped play. The deep voice of Tialoc Tesseract filled the little room. \n\u201cSomething seethes beneath us, comrades. A long-fingered darkness reaches up to the Warrens. Gather your breath, and the spoils of your greatest jumps. Band together, scavengers. War is coming.\u201d\n\n\n\tENTRY 11\n\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nBernal Tesseract\n06.04.2098\n\tIsn\u2019t there something in living dangerously?\n\n Bernal Tesseract sat alone in his room. On the desk his best gear was laid out before him, the spoils of 26 jumps. \nA drip from a pipe overhead marked time like a metronome. The drip pooled in a corner, making a puddle whose size, had anyone bothered to measure it, captured the exact number of seconds elapsed since the streetside factory above engaged its nightshift water supply. The resulting trickle disappeared down a drainage grate and ran into the Wet Tunnels, where it merged in the dark with a thousand other such rivulets, a writhing river of black and uncounted hours. \nBut Bernal could not indulge such thoughts. Not tonight. Instead, he pored over the gear on his desk, eyes bright. \nHe had been invited to appear before the Conclave. Their number had lately decreased by one\u2014a rare incident of rockdeath due to an overambitious jump. \nThe invitation itself was an honor, and marked him as one of the best scavengers in the clan. He had the collection to prove it. Trophies not only from the 80s and 90s, sunglasses and other souvenirs from the golden age of trifles, but an assortment of more utilitarian items from his own time as well. There was a darkscreen stolen from the Moles. A Veritas audiovid helmet with chem-detector, droid override, and IR display. And a cyborg wolf mask capable of rending iron with its adamantine teeth. \nStill, his acceptance was not guaranteed. They would interrogate him on stealth tactics. Psi resistance. Mech, tech, and demolitions. They would quiz him with an endless series of blending questions, queries meant to gauge how well he could pass for native in the times he jumped back to. It was no good trying to infiltrate (or party with) Berlin\u2019s Skate Punk Nihilists in the 80s if you didn\u2019t know the boards, the bands, and the lingo.\n\nFinally, they would grant him his baseline, an odd paragraph of interwoven and sometimes rhyming phrases that he would repeat at the conclusion of each jump. To ensure that his mind had not degraded. \nIf chosen by the Conclave he would join a guild of the most respected Dead Rabbits worldwide. Those entrusted with the most difficult missions. Those privy to the most secret machinations of the clan. Their name was known by everyone. Their number was 333. \nIf chosen by the Conclave, doors deep within the Warrens, doors dreamt about since a kit, would suddenly open to him. \nIf chosen by the Conclave, only his closest friends would continue to call him Bernal, and only then in the soft quiet of their private gatherings. \nThe rest would address him by his proper title.\n Supreme 237.\n\n\n\n\n\tENTRY 10\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nYamarashi Tesseract\n03.04.2098\n\t\u201cYour dreams, your feelings, the speed of your hand, the reflexive movement of your eye as it tracks a mosquito: In truth, all are chemical reactions at their root. And we have the chemicals you need to improve that truth.\u201d\n\n--Aquilus Melenard, Veritas Labs\nThe Veritas Labs VR set was legendary, even without accounting for the upgrades. For those with a craniospinal jack it offers, off-the-shelf:\n\nCopper conductors, for hyperfast reflexes. Conductivity: 97%\n\nT3NEMAR3 optics. 2000x EF-4 silicone dioxide lenses, polished to within .0000002 microns.\n\nOctapol Cables with HEX5 grounded connection points for reduced feedback, compressed surges, and force-limited earwig attacks.\n\nVeritas Boost: Jack-fed, proprietary chemical enhancements and blood assays. \nFull suite, Lethmite tracking software. For optimal performance, let Veritas know your location, body temperature, heart rate, dopamine saturation, galvanic skin response, audio\/visual experience, and nova habits. Cognitive mapping conveniently included.\nAfter three months in his workshop, Yamarashi Tesseract had completed these upgrades:\n\n\nCopper removed. Replaceable silver conductor cartridges installed throughout. Conductivity: 100%\n\nT3NEMAR3 lenses sonically polished to within .0000000007 microns.\n\nHand-soldered cable connection vacuum box. Fully isolated. Zero feedback, zero surges, earwig attacks impossible.\nLethmite tracking software purged. Update software rerouted to external drive.\nAfter maining the modified set in nova for 72 hours, Yamarashi Tesseract discarded his pulse rifle in favor of a vibrotachi. The rifle bored him. He found the sword a more enjoyable use of his new speed. Even without his targeting alarm--the amber flash in his HUD, the warning ping--it was elementary to spot movement and calculate the angles of enemy barrels.\nWhen bullets flew, he enjoyed simply not being there.\n\nAs he rose in the lists, Veritas drones began to stalk him, hovering over his battles, their camsets blinking. When he hit 200 kills without a death, Veritas upped its game. They tried to switch him off, with increasing levels of urgency, but each time it resulted only in a new line of code on the vidscreen of his connection box. Humorous.\nWhen they found that he had taken their tech off-grid, and improved upon it, Veritas implemented a new approach. He was actively hunted by MER7 Waspsins on the ground, in the air, and under the water while in nova. Every player with an on-grid set was a danger to him.\nSo Yamarashi made additional upgrades. He bypassed the jack-fed boost and installed direct implants to service his cerebellum and amygdala. He upgraded to pharm-grade adrenaline, GABA, and serotonin. He wired in radar\/sonar detection units and anti-firecontrol software to shut down opposing scanners and targeting. And he walked nova alone.\nIRL, he watched his back. Veritas had an army of skinjobs tasked with collecting delinquent payments, tracking would-be hackers and after-market fences, and carrying out hits on off-grid users like himself. They effectively discouraged black label use of their products with a tracking sentinel installed deep at the heart of the motherboard. Attempts to remove it resulted in an explosion large enough to destroy the hardware and a few offending fingers.\nYamarashi Tesseract had wired the sentinel with its own battery supply, confused it with a virus of his own design, then removed it entirely. \nHe had dropped the resulting mechanism in the hopper of a streetside trash bot and chuckled as the bot zoomed away, on its endless circuit of the city.\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 9\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nBernal Tesseract\n02.04.2098\n\tWe were dead but now we are free.\nBernal Tesseract woke to the smell of fear. \nHe scrambled from his bedding and sprinted the low access tunnel that led to the main Warrens. In the sleeping hall all was not well. The clan\u2019s bunks and nests lay empty. Some rabbits sat on their haunches, oddly, hunkered on the stone floor, their hands clutching their heads, as though trying to ward off some terrible and invisible pain. \nBut most of the clan stood rapt, erect, in neat lines they stood, and each line was eight rabbits long. \nAt their head stood a labour of Moles. Eight Moles in blue black robes had arranged themselves in a semicircle, they swayed gently in and out, rocking on their heels and murmuring in atonal unison. \nTheir darkscreens pulsed with sluggish ivory light that bathed the Warrens in a fractured, rhythmic flash. Bernal yawned. The smell of fear hung heavy all around him but this no longer struck him as important.\nIn the molesong he caught a glimpse of an underground tower, earthworks plunging boldly down into the dark, the masterwork of a great race, a place of nobility, a place full of secrets. It was a place he should like to visit, Bernal thought. Endless interweaving tunnels, glowing with grublight, caverns ringing with dirgesong, melancholy yes, but also beautiful, and far from the sharp intruding sun. An orderly place, where an honest rabbit could work hard for a sure meal and a dry place to sleep. \nBernal paused in his reverie, for this last thought took him aback. It seemed overwrought. Food came easy to his clan. The Dead Warrens were an excellent place to sleep. And of the rabbits he knew, most were wily, all were skilled, and none were overfond of work. He opened his eyes. \n\nA column of 24 rabbits, walking three abreast, were being led out of the sleeping hall by three Moles. The other five wandered among the stragglers, rabbits like himself who had not moved in response to the summons. One approached him, its darkscreen flashed white and Bernal felt a sizzling pain behind his eyes.\n\n\u201cFall in, worker.\u201d The Mole\u2019s voice was in his head. Bernal took a staggering step forward and stopped. He opened his mouth to cry out, to rally his clan, but a bright flash from the darkscreen and a sudden surge of pain silenced him.\n\u201cTry that again and I\u2019ll fry you,\u201d the Mole said. \u201cNow fall in.\u201d\nBernal gritted his teeth and refused to move. The Mole reached to adjust a dial on his darkscreen, but at that moment a dull yellow light spilled from the archway that led down into the Deep Warrens.\nThe Mole hissed, and his clan mates in the hall scurried to his side. The three Moles leading the column rushed back in to join their fellows. They formed a semicircle, their robes swayed about their feet as they rocked in and out. Each turned a dial on his darkscreen, a piercing electric hum filled the hall, and once again they intoned the molesong, waiting. They did not wait long. \nA huge green rabbit framed the archway, clad in scavenger armor, a pulse rifle slung across his back. He stared at the Moles from behind the glowing yellow optics of his rebreather helmet and stood his ground. The song of the Moles took on the pitch of an ululating shriek, their darkscreens flashed with white heat, and the psiwave they sent out before them was a visible violet net that crackled in the air.\n\nThe net never reached him. It erupted in a hail of sparks, its wasted energy outlining a perfect sphere of empty space that extended for a meter in all directions around the rabbit.\n\n\u201cDanger!\u201d shrieked the Moles. \u201cHe\u2019s psi-shielded! Retreat!\u201d \nBut it was too late for that. The rabbit touched a switch on his helmet and with an electric snap all eight darkscreens flashed searing white for an instant, and burned out. The Moles fell to the ground, writhing, and then went still.\n\u201cCast their bodies down into the grub tunnel,\u201d the green rabbit said. \u201cI think the Moles will not bother us for some time.\u201d\n\nWith that he turned back to the Deep Warrens, his pulse rifle still slung over his shoulder, untouched. The clan gathered together.\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d the young ones wanted to know. \nBernal Tesseract smiled.\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cwas Salnar Tesseract.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 8\n\nFROM THE \nRECORDINGS OF:\n\nAlma Tesseract\n01.23.2098\n\n\tAlma Tesseract leapt backward in the dark. Upon landing her heel struck a stone and she stumbled to the ground. Her hand flashed to her temple and her vizhelm crackled on.\n\n Three Moles loomed over her. How they got so close, and so quickly, without making a sound, she could not fathom. But there they were, swaying together in silent uncertain synchrony, their snouts in the air, sniffing.\n\n All three had darkscreens, implants, expensive. They wore robes of the same blue black color as their fur and none seemed to carry a weapon. The center Mole stiffened and stared down at her. A faint light flickered within the obsidian depth of his darkscreen, for an instant Alma thought she saw two white and wizened eyes. A shudder passed through the Mole, ripples ran down his snout.\n\n \u201cTime-hopper,\u201d he hissed. \u201cYour thoughts reveal your intent. But indeed we are armed, as you shall soon find out.\u201d He drew himself up and his companions leaned in, as though harmonizing.\n\n The psiwave hit her like a thunderclap. It surged out from the Moles unchecked and Alma found herself again in the dark, sound surrounded her like the rush of the ocean, her ears filled with it, and somewhere in that dizzy rumble hung a trace of song, a sleepy familiar song that her mother used to hum.\n\n Alma woke on her side. Her vizhelm had been removed. The Moles whispered to each other as they rifled through her pack.\n\n \u201cOld. Old. Old.\u201d one of them said.\n\n Alma heard the sounds of her gear being tossed aside.\n\n \u201cAh, but here\u2019s a medscan, save that.\u201d\n\n Soon enough they were finished. Alma\u2019s mind had cleared considerably, the muscles in her legs twitched and she felt her sense of balance return.\n\n \u201cPut these on her,\u201d the lead Mole said, taking something from his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring this one before the labour.\u201d\n\n Alma did not wait to find out what that meant. She bolted down the pitch dark tunnel, the Moles cried out behind her in dismay. She did not turn back. She rushed into the grublight and found her winch hanging where she left it. She snapped it to her belt, eyes straining down the tunnel for any sign of movement, and ascended through the hatchway. She slammed shut the hatch. It was dark, but familiar smells were all around. The Warrens were close.\n\nAlma put her arms out before her and groped her way along until at last the faint orange glow of the outer maintenance LEDs began to light her path. She exhaled.\n\n Her thoughts had turned to her report, and to the questions of the clan, when suddenly a Mole voice, thick with anger, hissed deep within her mind:\n\n \u201cGoodbye, time-hopper. For now.\u201d\n\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 7\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nAlma Tesseract\n01.17.2098\n\tThe hatch was badly rusted and stuck shut. Alma Tesseract ran her knife around the rim and struck the center with a length of rebar scrap. She cringed at the sound, a muted metallic clank that quickly faded.\n\n She was deep beneath the Warrens. Maintenance crawlways, drainage tubes, and air vents crisscrossed the rock, but even at this depth larger tunnels were still being discovered.\n\n With effort she freed the hatch and swung it open. Immediately her vizhelm registered a light source, she flicked off the IR broadcast in her HUD and waited for her eyes to adjust. Phosphorescence spilled from the hatchway, a cobalt green that made her think of blacklight.\n\n She fixed her grapmag to an iron girder and lowered herself into the tunnel. It was full-sized, 4 meters of line unwound to reach the base. Alma unclipped the winch from her belt and left it hanging.\n\n Faint light surrounded her. She guessed lichen would be the source, or a deep-dwelling fungus, but the light shifted somewhat, pulsated, and when she knelt for a closer look she saw that it came from grubs. Thousands of luminescent grubs meandered along the walls, feeding on regular streaks of what looked to be heavy black paste.\n\n There were no train tracks in the tunnel, which was odd. Alma enabled mapping and continued on. There was an acrid smell, not rot exactly, but sour. She much preferred the dry, old smell of the Warrens.\n\n After a time the paste on the walls disappeared, the grubs thinned out and the light dimmed. Alma tread on quietly, her eyes had adjusted and she did not want to spoil the walk with the HUD. But as she ventured further the dark in the tunnel became thick. Her breathing went shallow, she felt pressed in upon, and even her rabbit eyes could see nothing.\n\n Just at that time she entered a place of dangerous silence, a watchful quiet, that is the sound of several quiets overlapping.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in Mole Land,\u201d said a gravely voice. \u201cAnd should not be.\u201d\n\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 6\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nRhosgobel Tesseract\n\n01.13.2098\n\tThere are times when the air that floats between mortals becomes, in its stillness and silence, as cruel as the edge of a scythe.\n\n Nova changes you. After a year or two your pupils lose their color and your mind sharpens for tiny details, picking out shadows that lie at fractionally wrong angles, light misplaced by minutes from its proper channel in the day, the glint of platinum as opposed to gold.\n\n But in meat life you may miss important stimuli. Like a truck. Or a long flight of stairs. Or the difference between a crow and a gun.\n\n The distinction sharpens as your novatime piles up. Addiction is the first phase, but everyone past 2052 is addicted.

And the ones who plug up, the ones who upload memories and movement centers to nova: We call them aliens.\n\n Every population has them, those who have given up much to move a little closer to the singularity. In meat life they are removed, docile, and rarely met. But in nova you will know them. They see you from 10000 meters. They see you through walls. However fast, however strong, however skilled you are, it is laughable. Some of them can fly. And so we call them gods.\n\n From the Dead Rabbit clan, there have come six Alien Rabbit Gods.\n\n To consecrate these warrens, we intone their names.\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 5\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nBernal Tesseract\n\n01.10.2098\n\tBernal Tesseract stroked his whiskers and stared again at the sec-screen. It was old, circa 2050s, manufactured during a period when the retro green of the MS-DOS display had come back into vogue.\n\n It flashed the same code at him in rotation, maddeningly, again and again, across its curved monitor. It looked like M1T7R1Lhex, a basic security language that every rabbit learned as a kit. But each attempt he made to crack it from that framework failed\u2026and he was getting cold.\n\n Beyond the locked door somewhere, his Berliner comrades were holed up in warm tunnels, jacked into nova or gathered around a fire barrel, chewing braided grass.\n\n He had begun to shiver, and to give up hope of breaking the entrance code. He remembered a pile of old boxes he had passed earlier and was debating whether he could fashion them into a warm bed when it struck him: The code was not M1T7R1Lhex at all. It looked similar, but its principles, though equally simple, were entirely different.\n\n Suddenly the voice of Wilhelm Tesseract rang in his mind:\n\n Rabbits, when facing a problem, one must first determine what sort of problem it is. You cannot know the rules of a game before understanding which game is being played.\n\n Bernal smiled. He looked at the code once more, pressed a few buttons, and the door clicked open.\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 4\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nBernal Tesseract\n\n01.07.2098\n\tIf you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.\n\n The jump from London to New York has been established.\n\nThe grey dirge had been sung for Bernal Tesseract, and his bedding scattered before we heard him calling from the Wet Tunnels. A rope was lowered and we pulled him up, filthy and smiling.\n\n He looked good, for a young rabbit presumed lost to rockdeath.\n\n \u201cGlad I ended up back here with you lot,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cDidn\u2019t know where I was. But once I felt the water I was pretty sure I wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d\n\n The clan gathered around him, sniffing.\n\n \u201cI\u2019ve been elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not just in time. I\u2019ve had a visit with our comrades in New York. Leastwise, the ones who went back for the Straw Hat Riot of \u201822. A good time that was, snatching hats off heads, or else wearing them, and outrunning the mob. And let me say, City Hall Station looks grand, lit by electric chandelier.\u201d\n\n We all wanted to know how he did it, of course.\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s like a normal jump,\u201d he said, \u201cbut foggier. You\u2019ve got to let yourself drift. There\u2019s a cold spark, like the fear that comes from leaping over water, that one must give in to. Afterward, when you feel the pull, head toward it. It calls to you, bright, like the HUD on a vizhelm, and the trick is to not think much about it.\u201d\n\n This only made the clan more curious and it was not long until the jump over the Atlantic had become commonplace.\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 3\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nRhosgobel Tesseract\n\n01.06.2098\n\tAnd when we follow the cracks in the busted pavement like one would a map or a constellation of scars there are secret hearts speaking minor symphonies.\n\n NOTICE\n\nAll rabbits making jumps would do well to understand which system they\u2019re in, and when it was constructed.

Somewhere near the city. Somewhere unchanged for 100 years. And we found it in the abandoned subway tubes beneath the street. Networks of tunnels, and empty stations, their stairways bricked up, their tiled walls still plastered with moldering ink-press posters.\n\n Slowly we have made the place our own. Power we pirated from the street. Weeks were spent clearing the rubbish of another age, colored bottles, sturdy metal cans, and bag upon bag of cast-off ticket stubs. The upper levels we opened to topsiders, those who wander down in search of privacy, or adventure, or a refuge from the rain.\n\n But the deepest sections we keep only for our own. A heavy metal door stands guard. A flight of iron stairs spirals down. This is where the clan meets. Where we make our jumps, traveling back as far as we dare. Its name is called the Dead Warrens.\n\n Do you have the Watchword?\n\n\t\n\n\tENTRY 1\n\nFROM THE RECORDINGS OF:\nRhosgobel Tesseract\n\n01.02.2098\n\tIt was a bright day in April when Wilhelm Tesseract discovered he could jump through time. The year was 2097.\n\n Our clan have always been scavengers. We moved from place to place, scrounging used parts and cast-off clothes, camping in old subway tunnels and in the basements of abandoned factories. But as Wilhelm\u2019s ability spread throughout the clan, time jumping became our new way of life.\n\n We jump back to uncover secrets, play tricks, and hide clues about the future.

Who controls the present controls the past. <\/i><br><br>\nBernal staggered down the low tunnel, smearing blood along the rough rock at intervals as he leaned on the wall. <br><br>\nHis right eye was ruined, pulped by the butt of a Mole carbine\u2014it would need to be replaced. His right shoulder was torn open. But the slit in his SpecOps cloak did not match the jagged lacerations in his flesh. A Mole arcblade had sliced cleanly through the secsteel fibers; the wound itself Bernal had inflicted when he ripped out the gimpbolt. They would not take him down to Mole Town, not this time, not so easily. <br><br>\nFinally, he reached the end of the tunnel, set with a heavy steel door. Bernal keyed in his code, and slumped inside. <br><br>\nReception was empty, but he heard voices in the Staging Room and made his way toward the sound. <br><br>\nThey were gathered about the briefing table, many members of the Conclave and a handful of Supremes, standing. Some looked angry, others worried. One spotted him and coughed. Torsten Tesseract, head of the Conclave, swept a sheaf of papers from the table and rolled them up before Bernal could catch a good look. They were yellowed, aged, even through the pain he saw that much, and they had a musty smell. <br><br>\n\u201c237,\u201d Torsten said. \u201cYou look terrible. Glad you\u2019re alive, we\u2019ve had our doubts. Let\u2019s get you patched up.\u201d <br><br>\nThey led him down to the medbay. Bright lights and a dull blue operating table. A spot of red appeared on the floor, and another, he blinked dumbly, not registering what they were or where they came from. He felt the sting of a needle and slipped into darkness.<br><br>\n***<br>\n<br>\nHe awoke sitting upright in an elevated bed. His head hurt, but his vision was clear. Startlingly so. He could not, in fact, remember ever having seen so clearly in his life. He watched particles of dust flow on the channels of his breath, parting to pass around the chair, as water in a river parts to pass around stones. His eye came to rest on the crossbar at the foot of his bed. He zoomed in until he saw imperfections in the metal, tiny dark pockmarks in the chrome. With a start he zoomed out, too fast, and the change brought a sickness to his stomach. <br><br>\nTorsten Tesseract cleared his throat from the corner. \u201cYou\u2019re not all rabbit anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cYamarashi did that work himself, and from the look of you, it seems to function well.\u201d<br><br>\n Bernal nodded, remembering, and scanned the walls for a mirror. No luck. <br><br>\n\u201cMaybe best to wait on that for a bit,\u201d Torsten said. \u201cLet it heal. In the meantime, we have plenty to talk about. You\u2019ve been gone awhile. What happened out there?\u201d <br><br>\nBernal sucked in a breath. \u201cMoles. Ambushed us in Istanbul, 1890. Earlier than they\u2019ve ever been aggressive. Waiting for us in the tunnels, it was strange. They didn\u2019t have modern gear\u2014their equipment was vintage\u2014but it was cobbled together in a modern way. They had a functional radio. 5 years before radio was operational. And a seriously upgraded machine gun compared to anything available back then. I swear one had a makeshift darkscreen. It didn't work, from what I could tell anyway, but he must have had access to schematics. I'm not saying they can timejump. Yet. But I think they've figured a way to communicate through time.\u201d <br>\n<br>Torsten squinted. \u201cWho busted up your eye?\u201d <br><br>\n\u201cThese 1890\u2019s Moles weren\u2019t just singers,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cThey had Grunts too. No Molechoir this trip, just shooting and bashing. Something has changed.\u201d <br><br>\nTorsten drew a recpad from his pocket. \u201cWe knew it was bad when Tialoc spoke, two nights ago. Here's what he had to say.\"<br>\n<br>The leader of the Conclave held up the device and tapped play. The deep voice of Tialoc Tesseract filled the little room. <br><br>\n\u201cSomething seethes beneath us, comrades. A long-fingered darkness reaches up to the Warrens. Gather your breath, and the spoils of your greatest jumps. Band together, scavengers.

On the desk his best gear was laid out before him, the spoils of 26 jumps. <br><br>\nA drip from a pipe overhead marked time like a metronome. The drip pooled in a corner, making a puddle whose size, had anyone bothered to measure it, captured the exact number of seconds elapsed since the streetside factory above engaged its nightshift water supply. The resulting trickle disappeared down a drainage grate and ran into the Wet Tunnels, where it merged in the dark with a thousand other such rivulets, a writhing river of black and uncounted hours. <br><br>\nBut Bernal could not indulge such thoughts. Not tonight. Instead, he pored over the gear on his desk, eyes bright. <br><br>\nHe had been invited to appear before the Conclave. Their number had lately decreased by one\u2014a rare incident of rockdeath due to an overambitious jump. <br><br>\nThe invitation itself was an honor, and marked him as one of the best scavengers in the clan. He had the collection to prove it. Trophies not only from the 80s and 90s, sunglasses and other souvenirs from the golden age of trifles, but an assortment of more utilitarian items from his own time as well. There was a darkscreen stolen from the Moles. A Veritas audiovid helmet with chem-detector, droid override, and IR display. And a cyborg wolf mask capable of rending iron with its adamantine teeth. <br><br>\nStill, his acceptance was not guaranteed. They would interrogate him on stealth tactics. Psi resistance. Mech, tech, and demolitions. They would quiz him with an endless series of blending questions, queries meant to gauge how well he could pass for native in the times he jumped back to. It was no good trying to infiltrate (or party with) Berlin\u2019s Skate Punk Nihilists in the 80s if you didn\u2019t know the boards, the bands, and the lingo.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, they would grant him his baseline, an odd paragraph of interwoven and sometimes rhyming phrases that he would repeat at the conclusion of each jump. To ensure that his mind had not degraded. <br><br>\nIf chosen by the Conclave he would join a guild of the most respected Dead Rabbits worldwide. Those entrusted with the most difficult missions. Those privy to the most secret machinations of the clan. Their name was known by everyone. Their number was 333. <br><br>\nIf chosen by the Conclave, doors deep within the Warrens, doors dreamt about since a kit, would suddenly open to him. <br><br>\nIf chosen by the Conclave, only his closest friends would continue to call him Bernal, and only then in the soft quiet of their private gatherings. <br><br>\nThe rest would address him by his proper title.<br><br>\n Supreme 237.<br>\n<br>\n<hr><br>\n<br>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 10<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Yamarashi Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">03.04.2098<\/span>\n\t<i>\u201cYour dreams, your feelings, the speed of your hand, the reflexive movement of your eye as it tracks a mosquito: In truth, all are chemical reactions at their root.

Update software rerouted to external drive.<\/li><\/ul><br>\nAfter maining the modified set in nova for 72 hours, Yamarashi Tesseract discarded his pulse rifle in favor of a vibrotachi. The rifle bored him. He found the sword a more enjoyable use of his new speed. Even without his targeting alarm--the amber flash in his HUD, the warning ping--it was elementary to spot movement and calculate the angles of enemy barrels.<br><br>\nWhen bullets flew, he enjoyed simply not being there.<br>\n<br>\nAs he rose in the lists, Veritas drones began to stalk him, hovering over his battles, their camsets blinking. When he hit 200 kills without a death, Veritas upped its game. They tried to switch him off, with increasing levels of urgency, but each time it resulted only in a new line of code on the vidscreen of his connection box. Humorous.<br><br>\nWhen they found that he had taken their tech off-grid, and improved upon it, Veritas implemented a new approach. He was actively hunted by MER7 Waspsins on the ground, in the air, and under the water while in nova. Every player with an on-grid set was a danger to him.<br><br>\nSo Yamarashi made additional upgrades. He bypassed the jack-fed boost and installed direct implants to service his cerebellum and amygdala. He upgraded to pharm-grade adrenaline, GABA, and serotonin. He wired in radar\/sonar detection units and anti-firecontrol software to shut down opposing scanners and targeting. And he walked nova alone.<br><br>\nIRL, he watched his back. Veritas had an army of skinjobs tasked with collecting delinquent payments, tracking would-be hackers and after-market fences, and carrying out hits on off-grid users like himself. They effectively discouraged black label use of their products with a tracking sentinel installed deep at the heart of the motherboard. Attempts to remove it resulted in an explosion large enough to destroy the hardware and a few offending fingers.<br><br>\nYamarashi Tesseract had wired the sentinel with its own battery supply, confused it with a virus of his own design, then removed it entirely. \nHe had dropped the resulting mechanism in the hopper of a streetside trash bot and chuckled as the bot zoomed away, on its endless circuit of the city.\n\n\t<hr>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 9<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Bernal Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">02.04.2098<\/span>\n\t<i>We were dead but now we are free.<\/i><br><br>\nBernal Tesseract woke to the smell of fear. <br><br>\nHe scrambled from his bedding and sprinted the low access tunnel that led to the main Warrens. In the sleeping hall all was not well. The clan\u2019s bunks and nests lay empty. Some rabbits sat on their haunches, oddly, hunkered on the stone floor, their hands clutching their heads, as though trying to ward off some terrible and invisible pain. <br><br>\nBut most of the clan stood rapt, erect, in neat lines they stood, and each line was eight rabbits long. <br><br>\nAt their head stood a labour of Moles. Eight Moles in blue black robes had arranged themselves in a semicircle, they swayed gently in and out, rocking on their heels and murmuring in atonal unison. <br><br>\nTheir darkscreens pulsed with sluggish ivory light that bathed the Warrens in a fractured, rhythmic flash. Bernal yawned. The smell of fear hung heavy all around him but this no longer struck him as important.<br><br>\nIn the molesong he caught a glimpse of an underground tower, earthworks plunging boldly down into the dark, the masterwork of a great race, a place of nobility, a place full of secrets. It was a place he should like to visit, Bernal thought. Endless interweaving tunnels, glowing with grublight, caverns ringing with dirgesong, melancholy yes, but also beautiful, and far from the sharp intruding sun. An orderly place, where an honest rabbit could work hard for a sure meal and a dry place to sleep. <br><br>\nBernal paused in his reverie, for this last thought took him aback. It seemed overwrought. Food came easy to his clan. The Dead Warrens were an excellent place to sleep. And of the rabbits he knew, most were wily, all were skilled, and none were overfond of work. He opened his eyes. <br>\n<br>\nA column of 24 rabbits, walking three abreast, were being led out of the sleeping hall by three Moles. The other five wandered among the stragglers, rabbits like himself who had not moved in response to the summons. One approached him, its darkscreen flashed white and Bernal felt a sizzling pain behind his eyes.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cFall in, worker.\u201d The Mole\u2019s voice was in his head. Bernal took a staggering step forward and stopped. He opened his mouth to cry out, to rally his clan, but a bright flash from the darkscreen and a sudden surge of pain silenced him.<br><br>\n\u201cTry that again and I\u2019ll fry you,\u201d the Mole said. \u201cNow fall in.\u201d<br><br>\nBernal gritted his teeth and refused to move. The Mole reached to adjust a dial on his darkscreen, but at that moment a dull yellow light spilled from the archway that led down into the Deep Warrens.<br><br>\nThe Mole hissed, and his clan mates in the hall scurried to his side. The three Moles leading the column rushed back in to join their fellows. They formed a semicircle, their robes swayed about their feet as they rocked in and out. Each turned a dial on his darkscreen, a piercing electric hum filled the hall, and once again they intoned the molesong, waiting. They did not wait long. <br><br>\nA huge green rabbit framed the archway, clad in scavenger armor, a pulse rifle slung across his back. He stared at the Moles from behind the glowing yellow optics of his rebreather helmet and stood his ground. The song of the Moles took on the pitch of an ululating shriek, their darkscreens flashed with white heat, and the psiwave they sent out before them was a visible violet net that crackled in the air.<br>\n<br>\nThe net never reached him. It erupted in a hail of sparks, its wasted energy outlining a perfect sphere of empty space that extended for a meter in all directions around the rabbit.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDanger!\u201d shrieked the Moles. \u201cHe\u2019s psi-shielded! Retreat!\u201d <br><br>\nBut it was too late for that. The rabbit touched a switch on his helmet and with an electric snap all eight darkscreens flashed searing white for an instant, and burned out. The Moles fell to the ground, writhing, and then went still.<br><br>\n\u201cCast their bodies down into the grub tunnel,\u201d the green rabbit said. \u201cI think the Moles will not bother us for some time.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nWith that he turned back to the Deep Warrens, his pulse rifle still slung over his shoulder, untouched. The clan gathered together.<br><br>\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d the young ones wanted to know. <br><br>\nBernal Tesseract smiled.<br>\n<br>\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cwas Salnar Tesseract.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\t<hr>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 8<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>\nRECORDINGS OF:\n<br>\n<b>Alma Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.23.2098<\/span>\n\n\tAlma Tesseract leapt backward in the dark. Upon landing her heel struck a stone and she stumbled to the ground. Her hand flashed to her temple and her vizhelm crackled on.<br>\n<br>\n Three Moles loomed over her. How they got so close, and so quickly, without making a sound, she could not fathom. But there they were, swaying together in silent uncertain synchrony, their snouts in the air, sniffing.<br>\n<br>\n All three had darkscreens, implants, expensive. They wore robes of the same blue black color as their fur and none seemed to carry a weapon. The center Mole stiffened and stared down at her. A faint light flickered within the obsidian depth of his darkscreen, for an instant Alma thought she saw two white and wizened eyes. A shudder passed through the Mole, ripples ran down his snout.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cTime-hopper,\u201d he hissed. \u201cYour thoughts reveal your intent. But indeed we are armed, as you shall soon find out.\u201d He drew himself up and his companions leaned in, as though harmonizing.<br>\n<br>\n The psiwave hit her like a thunderclap. It surged out from the Moles unchecked and Alma found herself again in the dark, sound surrounded her like the rush of the ocean, her ears filled with it, and somewhere in that dizzy rumble hung a trace of song, a sleepy familiar song that her mother used to hum.<br>\n<br>\n Alma woke on her side. Her vizhelm had been removed. The Moles whispered to each other as they rifled through her pack.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cOld. Old. Old.\u201d one of them said.<br>\n<br>\n Alma heard the sounds of her gear being tossed aside.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cAh, but here\u2019s a medscan, save that.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n Soon enough they were finished. Alma\u2019s mind had cleared considerably, the muscles in her legs twitched and she felt her sense of balance return.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cPut these on her,\u201d the lead Mole said, taking something from his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring this one before the labour.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n Alma did not wait to find out what that meant. She bolted down the pitch dark tunnel, the Moles cried out behind her in dismay. She did not turn back. She rushed into the grublight and found her winch hanging where she left it. She snapped it to her belt, eyes straining down the tunnel for any sign of movement, and ascended through the hatchway. She slammed shut the hatch. It was dark, but familiar smells were all around. The Warrens were close.<br>\n<br>\nAlma put her arms out before her and groped her way along until at last the faint orange glow of the outer maintenance LEDs began to light her path. She exhaled.<br>\n<br>\n Her thoughts had turned to her report, and to the questions of the clan, when suddenly a Mole voice, thick with anger, hissed deep within her mind:<br>\n<br>\n \u201cGoodbye, time-hopper. For now.\u201d<br><br>\n\n\n\t<hr>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 7<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Alma Tesseract<\/b><br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.17.2098<\/span>\n\tThe hatch was badly rusted and stuck shut. Alma Tesseract ran her knife around the rim and struck the center with a length of rebar scrap. She cringed at the sound, a muted metallic clank that quickly faded.<br>\n<br>\n She was deep beneath the Warrens. Maintenance crawlways, drainage tubes, and air vents crisscrossed the rock, but even at this depth larger tunnels were still being discovered.<br>\n<br>\n With effort she freed the hatch and swung it open. Immediately her vizhelm registered a light source, she flicked off the IR broadcast in her HUD and waited for her eyes to adjust. Phosphorescence spilled from the hatchway, a cobalt green that made her think of blacklight.<br>\n<br>\n She fixed her grapmag to an iron girder and lowered herself into the tunnel. It was full-sized, 4 meters of line unwound to reach the base. Alma unclipped the winch from her belt and left it hanging.<br>\n<br>\n Faint light surrounded her. She guessed lichen would be the source, or a deep-dwelling fungus, but the light shifted somewhat, pulsated, and when she knelt for a closer look she saw that it came from grubs. Thousands of luminescent grubs meandered along the walls, feeding on regular streaks of what looked to be heavy black paste.<br>\n<br>\n There were no train tracks in the tunnel, which was odd. Alma enabled mapping and continued on. There was an acrid smell, not rot exactly, but sour. She much preferred the dry, old smell of the Warrens.<br>\n<br>\n After a time the paste on the walls disappeared, the grubs thinned out and the light dimmed. Alma tread on quietly, her eyes had adjusted and she did not want to spoil the walk with the HUD. But as she ventured further the dark in the tunnel became thick. Her breathing went shallow, she felt pressed in upon, and even her rabbit eyes could see nothing.<br>\n<br>\n Just at that time she entered a place of dangerous silence, a watchful quiet, that is the sound of several quiets overlapping.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re in Mole Land,\u201d said a gravely voice. \u201cAnd should not be.\u201d<br><br>\n\n\n\t<hr>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 6<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Rhosgobel Tesseract<\/b>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.13.2098<\/span>\n\t<i>There are times when the air that floats between mortals becomes, in its stillness and silence, as cruel as the edge of a scythe.<\/i><br>\n<br>\n Nova changes you. After a year or two your pupils lose their color and your mind sharpens for tiny details, picking out shadows that lie at fractionally wrong angles, light misplaced by minutes from its proper channel in the day, the glint of platinum as opposed to gold.<br>\n<br>\n But in meat life you may miss important stimuli. Like a truck. Or a long flight of stairs. Or the difference between a crow and a gun.<br>\n<br>\n The distinction sharpens as your novatime piles up. Addiction is the first phase, but everyone past 2052 is addicted. When your body changes, when your mind begins to shake its confines and stretch out within its preferred domain, when implants become a real consideration\u2013faster uploads, faster reflexes, sharper vision\u2013that\u2019s when the choice kicks in.<br>\n<br>\n We call it going alien. And the ones who plug up, the ones who upload memories and movement centers to nova: We call them aliens.<br>\n<br>\n Every population has them, those who have given up much to move a little closer to the singularity. In meat life they are removed, docile, and rarely met. But in nova you will know them. They see you from 10000 meters. They see you through walls. However fast, however strong, however skilled you are, it is laughable. Some of them can fly. And so we call them gods.<br>\n<br>\n From the Dead Rabbit clan, there have come six Alien Rabbit Gods.<br>\n<br>\n To consecrate these warrens, we intone their names.<br><br><br>\n\n\t<hr>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 5<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Bernal Tesseract<\/b>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.10.2098<\/span>\n\tBernal Tesseract stroked his whiskers and stared again at the sec-screen. It was old, circa 2050s, manufactured during a period when the retro green of the MS-DOS display had come back into vogue.<br>\n<br>\n It flashed the same code at him in rotation, maddeningly, again and again, across its curved monitor. It looked like M1T7R1Lhex, a basic security language that every rabbit learned as a kit. But each attempt he made to crack it from that framework failed\u2026and he was getting cold.<br>\n<br>\n Beyond the locked door somewhere, his Berliner comrades were holed up in warm tunnels, jacked into nova or gathered around a fire barrel, chewing braided grass.<br>\n<br>\n He had begun to shiver, and to give up hope of breaking the entrance code. He remembered a pile of old boxes he had passed earlier and was debating whether he could fashion them into a warm bed when it struck him: The code was not M1T7R1Lhex at all. It looked similar, but its principles, though equally simple, were entirely different.<br>\n<br>\n Suddenly the voice of Wilhelm Tesseract rang in his mind:<br>\n<br>\n <i>Rabbits, when facing a problem, one must first determine what sort of problem it is. You cannot know the rules of a game before understanding which game is being played.<\/i><br>\n<br>\n Bernal smiled. He looked at the code once more, pressed a few buttons, and the door clicked open.\n\n\t<hr>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 4<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Bernal Tesseract<\/b>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.07.2098<\/span>\n\t<i>If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.<\/i><br>\n<br>\n The jump from London to New York has been established.<br>\n<br>\nThe grey dirge had been sung for Bernal Tesseract, and his bedding scattered before we heard him calling from the Wet Tunnels.

I\u2019ve had a visit with our comrades in New York. Leastwise, the ones who went back for the Straw Hat Riot of \u201822. A good time that was, snatching hats off heads, or else wearing them, and outrunning the mob. And let me say, City Hall Station looks grand, lit by electric chandelier.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n We all wanted to know how he did it, of course.<br>\n<br>\n \u201cIt\u2019s like a normal jump,\u201d he said, \u201cbut foggier. You\u2019ve got to let yourself drift. There\u2019s a cold spark, like the fear that comes from leaping over water, that one must give in to. Afterward, when you feel the pull, head toward it. It calls to you, bright, like the HUD on a vizhelm, and the trick is to not think much about it.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n This only made the clan more curious and it was not long until the jump over the Atlantic had become commonplace.<br>\n\n\t<hr>\n\n\t<h2>ENTRY 3<\/h2><br>\n<br>\n<hr>FROM THE <br>RECORDINGS OF:<br>\n<b>Rhosgobel Tesseract<\/b>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #6e6e6e;\">01.06.2098<\/span>\n\t<i>And when we follow the cracks in the busted pavement like one would a map or a constellation of scars there are secret hearts speaking minor symphonies.<\/i><br>\n<br>\n NOTICE<br>\n<br>\nAll rabbits making jumps would do well to understand which system they\u2019re in, and when it was constructed.

Networks of tunnels, and empty stations, their stairways bricked up, their tiled walls still plastered with moldering ink-press posters.<br>\n<br>\n Slowly we have made the place our own. Power we pirated from the street. Weeks were spent clearing the rubbish of another age, colored bottles, sturdy metal cans, and bag upon bag of cast-off ticket stubs. The upper levels we opened to topsiders, those who wander down in search of privacy, or adventure, or a refuge from the rain.<br>\n<br>\n But the deepest sections we keep only for our own. A heavy metal door stands guard. A flight of iron stairs spirals down. This is where the clan meets. Where we make our jumps, traveling back as far as we dare.

Bernal staggered down the low tunnel, smearing blood along the rough rock at intervals as he leaned on the wall. <br><br>
His right eye was ruined, pulped by the butt of a Mole carbineâit would need to be replaced. His right shoulder was torn open. But the slit in his SpecOps cloak did not match the jagged lacerations in his flesh. A Mole arcblade had sliced cleanly through the secsteel fibers; the wound itself Bernal had inflicted when he ripped out the gimpbolt. They would not take him down to Mole Town, not this time, not so easily. <br><br>
Finally, he reached the end of the tunnel, set with a heavy steel door. Bernal keyed in his code, and slumped inside. <br><br>
Reception was empty, but he heard voices in the Staging Room and made his way toward the sound. <br><br>
They were gathered about the briefing table, many members of the Conclave and a handful of Supremes, standing. Some looked angry, others worried. One spotted him and coughed. Torsten Tesseract, head of the Conclave, swept a sheaf of papers from the table and rolled them up before Bernal could catch a good look. They were yellowed, aged, even through the pain he saw that much, and they had a musty smell. <br><br>
â237,â Torsten said. âYou look terrible. Glad youâre alive, weâve had our doubts. Letâs get you patched up.â <br><br>
They led him down to the medbay. Bright lights and a dull blue operating table. A spot of red appeared on the floor, and another, he blinked dumbly, not registering what they were or where they came from. He felt the sting of a needle and slipped into darkness.<br><br>
***<br>
<br>
He awoke sitting upright in an elevated bed. His head hurt, but his vision was clear. Startlingly so. He could not, in fact, remember ever having seen so clearly in his life. He watched particles of dust flow on the channels of his breath, parting to pass around the chair, as water in a river parts to pass around stones. His eye came to rest on the crossbar at the foot of his bed. He zoomed in until he saw imperfections in the metal, tiny dark pockmarks in the chrome. With a start he zoomed out, too fast, and the change brought a sickness to his stomach. <br><br>
Torsten Tesseract cleared his throat from the corner. âYouâre not all rabbit anymore,â he said. âYamarashi did that work himself, and from the look of you, it seems to function well.â<br><br>
 Bernal nodded, remembering, and scanned the walls for a mirror. No luck. <br><br>
âMaybe best to wait on that for a bit,â Torsten said. âLet it heal. In the meantime, we have plenty to talk about. Youâve been gone awhile. What happened out there?â <br><br>
Bernal sucked in a breath. âMoles. Ambushed us in Istanbul, 1890. Earlier than theyâve ever been aggressive. Waiting for us in the tunnels, it was strange. They didnât have modern gearâtheir equipment was vintageâbut it was cobbled together in a modern way. They had a functional radio. 5 years before radio was operational. And a seriously upgraded machine gun compared to anything available back then. I swear one had a makeshift darkscreen. It didn't work, from what I could tell anyway, but he must have had access to schematics. I'm not saying they can timejump. Yet. But I think they've figured a way to communicate through time.â <br>
<br>Torsten squinted. âWho busted up your eye?â <br><br>
âThese 1890âs Moles werenât just singers,â Bernal said. âThey had Grunts too. No Molechoir this trip, just shooting and bashing. Something has changed.â <br><br>
Torsten drew a recpad from his pocket. âWe knew it was bad when Tialoc spoke, two nights ago. Here's what he had to say."<br>
<br>The leader of the Conclave held up the device and tapped play. The deep voice of Tialoc Tesseract filled the little room. <br><br>
âSomething seethes beneath us, comrades. A long-fingered darkness reaches up to the Warrens. Gather your breath, and the spoils of your greatest jumps. Band together, scavengers. War is coming.â</div><br>

<br>
 Bernal Tesseract sat alone in his room. On the desk his best gear was laid out before him, the spoils of 26 jumps. <br><br>
A drip from a pipe overhead marked time like a metronome. The drip pooled in a corner, making a puddle whose size, had anyone bothered to measure it, captured the exact number of seconds elapsed since the streetside factory above engaged its nightshift water supply. The resulting trickle disappeared down a drainage grate and ran into the Wet Tunnels, where it merged in the dark with a thousand other such rivulets, a writhing river of black and uncounted hours. <br><br>
But Bernal could not indulge such thoughts. Not tonight. Instead, he pored over the gear on his desk, eyes bright. <br><br>
He had been invited to appear before the Conclave. Their number had lately decreased by oneâa rare incident of rockdeath due to an overambitious jump. <br><br>
The invitation itself was an honor, and marked him as one of the best scavengers in the clan. He had the collection to prove it. Trophies not only from the 80s and 90s, sunglasses and other souvenirs from the golden age of trifles, but an assortment of more utilitarian items from his own time as well. There was a darkscreen stolen from the Moles. A Veritas audiovid helmet with chem-detector, droid override, and IR display. And a cyborg wolf mask capable of rending iron with its adamantine teeth. <br><br>
Still, his acceptance was not guaranteed. They would interrogate him on stealth tactics. Psi resistance. Mech, tech, and demolitions. They would quiz him with an endless series of blending questions, queries meant to gauge how well he could pass for native in the times he jumped back to. It was no good trying to infiltrate (or party with) Berlinâs Skate Punk Nihilists in the 80s if you didnât know the boards, the bands, and the lingo.<br></div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">Finally, they would grant him his baseline, an odd paragraph of interwoven and sometimes rhyming phrases that he would repeat at the conclusion of each jump. To ensure that his mind had not degraded. <br><br>
If chosen by the Conclave he would join a guild of the most respected Dead Rabbits worldwide. Those entrusted with the most difficult missions. Those privy to the most secret machinations of the clan. Their name was known by everyone. Their number was 333. <br><br>
If chosen by the Conclave, doors deep within the Warrens, doors dreamt about since a kit, would suddenly open to him. <br><br>
If chosen by the Conclave, only his closest friends would continue to call him Bernal, and only then in the soft quiet of their private gatherings. <br><br>
The rest would address him by his proper title.<br><br>

Octapol Cables with HEX5 grounded connection points for reduced feedback, compressed surges, and force-limited earwig attacks.
<br></li><li>
Veritas Boost: Jack-fed, proprietary chemical enhancements and blood assays. <br></li><li>
Full suite, Lethmite tracking software. For optimal performance, let Veritas know your location, body temperature, heart rate, dopamine saturation, galvanic skin response, audio/visual experience, and nova habits. Cognitive mapping conveniently included.<br></li></ul><br>
After three months in his workshop, Yamarashi Tesseract had completed these upgrades:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>
Copper removed. Replaceable silver conductor cartridges installed throughout. Conductivity: 100%
<br></li><li>
T3NEMAR3 lenses sonically polished to within .0000000007 microns.
<br></li><li>
Hand-soldered cable connection vacuum box. Fully isolated. Zero feedback, zero surges, earwig attacks impossible.</li><li>
Lethmite tracking software purged. Update software rerouted to external drive.</li></ul><br>
After maining the modified set in nova for 72 hours, Yamarashi Tesseract discarded his pulse rifle in favor of a vibrotachi. The rifle bored him. He found the sword a more enjoyable use of his new speed. Even without his targeting alarm--the amber flash in his HUD, the warning ping--it was elementary to spot movement and calculate the angles of enemy barrels.<br><br>
When bullets flew, he enjoyed simply not being there.<br>
<br>
As he rose in the lists, Veritas drones began to stalk him, hovering over his battles, their camsets blinking. When he hit 200 kills without a death, Veritas upped its game. They tried to switch him off, with increasing levels of urgency, but each time it resulted only in a new line of code on the vidscreen of his connection box. Humorous.<br><br>
When they found that he had taken their tech off-grid, and improved upon it, Veritas implemented a new approach. He was actively hunted by MER7 Waspsins on the ground, in the air, and under the water while in nova. Every player with an on-grid set was a danger to him.<br><br>
So Yamarashi made additional upgrades. He bypassed the jack-fed boost and installed direct implants to service his cerebellum and amygdala. He upgraded to pharm-grade adrenaline, GABA, and serotonin. He wired in radar/sonar detection units and anti-firecontrol software to shut down opposing scanners and targeting. And he walked nova alone.<br><br>
IRL, he watched his back. Veritas had an army of skinjobs tasked with collecting delinquent payments, tracking would-be hackers and after-market fences, and carrying out hits on off-grid users like himself. They effectively discouraged black label use of their products with a tracking sentinel installed deep at the heart of the motherboard. Attempts to remove it resulted in an explosion large enough to destroy the hardware and a few offending fingers.<br><br>
Yamarashi Tesseract had wired the sentinel with its own battery supply, confused it with a virus of his own design, then removed it entirely. 
He had dropped the resulting mechanism in the hopper of a streetside trash bot and chuckled as the bot zoomed away, on its endless circuit of the city.</div></div>

	<div grid-col="9" grid-pad="3" class=""><div style="text-align: left;"><i>We were dead but now we are free.</i><br><br>
Bernal Tesseract woke to the smell of fear. <br><br>
He scrambled from his bedding and sprinted the low access tunnel that led to the main Warrens. In the sleeping hall all was not well. The clanâs bunks and nests lay empty. Some rabbits sat on their haunches, oddly, hunkered on the stone floor, their hands clutching their heads, as though trying to ward off some terrible and invisible pain. <br><br>
But most of the clan stood rapt, erect, in neat lines they stood, and each line was eight rabbits long. <br><br>
At their head stood a labour of Moles. Eight Moles in blue black robes had arranged themselves in a semicircle, they swayed gently in and out, rocking on their heels and murmuring in atonal unison. <br><br>
Their darkscreens pulsed with sluggish ivory light that bathed the Warrens in a fractured, rhythmic flash. Bernal yawned. The smell of fear hung heavy all around him but this no longer struck him as important.<br><br>
In the molesong he caught a glimpse of an underground tower, earthworks plunging boldly down into the dark, the masterwork of a great race, a place of nobility, a place full of secrets. It was a place he should like to visit, Bernal thought. Endless interweaving tunnels, glowing with grublight, caverns ringing with dirgesong, melancholy yes, but also beautiful, and far from the sharp intruding sun. An orderly place, where an honest rabbit could work hard for a sure meal and a dry place to sleep. <br><br>
Bernal paused in his reverie, for this last thought took him aback. It seemed overwrought. Food came easy to his clan. The Dead Warrens were an excellent place to sleep. And of the rabbits he knew, most were wily, all were skilled, and none were overfond of work. He opened his eyes. <br>
<br>
A column of 24 rabbits, walking three abreast, were being led out of the sleeping hall by three Moles. The other five wandered among the stragglers, rabbits like himself who had not moved in response to the summons. One approached him, its darkscreen flashed white and Bernal felt a sizzling pain behind his eyes.<br>
<br>
âFall in, worker.â The Moleâs voice was in his head. Bernal took a staggering step forward and stopped. He opened his mouth to cry out, to rally his clan, but a bright flash from the darkscreen and a sudden surge of pain silenced him.<br><br>
âTry that again and Iâll fry you,â the Mole said. âNow fall in.â<br><br>
Bernal gritted his teeth and refused to move. The Mole reached to adjust a dial on his darkscreen, but at that moment a dull yellow light spilled from the archway that led down into the Deep Warrens.<br><br>
The Mole hissed, and his clan mates in the hall scurried to his side. The three Moles leading the column rushed back in to join their fellows. They formed a semicircle, their robes swayed about their feet as they rocked in and out. Each turned a dial on his darkscreen, a piercing electric hum filled the hall, and once again they intoned the molesong, waiting. They did not wait long. <br><br>
A huge green rabbit framed the archway, clad in scavenger armor, a pulse rifle slung across his back. He stared at the Moles from behind the glowing yellow optics of his rebreather helmet and stood his ground. The song of the Moles took on the pitch of an ululating shriek, their darkscreens flashed with white heat, and the psiwave they sent out before them was a visible violet net that crackled in the air.<br>
<br>
The net never reached him. It erupted in a hail of sparks, its wasted energy outlining a perfect sphere of empty space that extended for a meter in all directions around the rabbit.<br>
<br>
âDanger!â shrieked the Moles. âHeâs psi-shielded! Retreat!â <br><br>
But it was too late for that. The rabbit touched a switch on his helmet and with an electric snap all eight darkscreens flashed searing white for an instant, and burned out. The Moles fell to the ground, writhing, and then went still.<br><br>
âCast their bodies down into the grub tunnel,â the green rabbit said. âI think the Moles will not bother us for some time.â<br>
<br>
With that he turned back to the Deep Warrens, his pulse rifle still slung over his shoulder, untouched. The clan gathered together.<br><br>
âWho was that?â the young ones wanted to know. <br><br>
Bernal Tesseract smiled.<br>
<br>âThat,â he said, âwas Salnar Tesseract.â&nbsp;</div></div>

</div>
	<div grid-col="9" grid-pad="3" class=""><div style="text-align: left;">Alma Tesseract leapt backward in the dark. Upon landing her heel struck a stone and she stumbled to the ground. Her hand flashed to her temple and her vizhelm crackled on.<br>
<br>
 Three Moles loomed over her. How they got so close, and so quickly, without making a sound, she could not fathom. But there they were, swaying together in silent uncertain synchrony, their snouts in the air, sniffing.<br>
<br>
 All three had darkscreens, implants, expensive. They wore robes of the same blue black color as their fur and none seemed to carry a weapon. The center Mole stiffened and stared down at her. A faint light flickered within the obsidian depth of his darkscreen, for an instant Alma thought she saw two white and wizened eyes. A shudder passed through the Mole, ripples ran down his snout.<br>
<br>
 âTime-hopper,â he hissed. âYour thoughts reveal your intent. But indeed we are armed, as you shall soon find out.â He drew himself up and his companions leaned in, as though harmonizing.<br>
<br>
 The psiwave hit her like a thunderclap. It surged out from the Moles unchecked and Alma found herself again in the dark, sound surrounded her like the rush of the ocean, her ears filled with it, and somewhere in that dizzy rumble hung a trace of song, a sleepy familiar song that her mother used to hum.<br>
<br>
 Alma woke on her side. Her vizhelm had been removed. The Moles whispered to each other as they rifled through her pack.<br>
<br>
 âOld. Old. Old.â one of them said.<br>
<br>
 Alma heard the sounds of her gear being tossed aside.<br>
<br>
 âAh, but hereâs a medscan, save that.â<br>
<br>
 Soon enough they were finished. Almaâs mind had cleared considerably, the muscles in her legs twitched and she felt her sense of balance return.<br>
<br>
 âPut these on her,â the lead Mole said, taking something from his pocket. âWeâll bring this one before the labour.â<br>
<br>
 Alma did not wait to find out what that meant. She bolted down the pitch dark tunnel, the Moles cried out behind her in dismay. She did not turn back. She rushed into the grublight and found her winch hanging where she left it. She snapped it to her belt, eyes straining down the tunnel for any sign of movement, and ascended through the hatchway. She slammed shut the hatch. It was dark, but familiar smells were all around. The Warrens were close.<br>
<br>
Alma put her arms out before her and groped her way along until at last the faint orange glow of the outer maintenance LEDs began to light her path. She exhaled.<br>
<br>
 Her thoughts had turned to her report, and to the questions of the clan, when suddenly a Mole voice, thick with anger, hissed deep within her mind:<br>
<br>
 âGoodbye, time-hopper. For now.â<br><br>

	<div grid-col="9" grid-pad="3" class=""><div style="text-align: left;">The hatch was badly rusted and stuck shut. Alma Tesseract ran her knife around the rim and struck the center with a length of rebar scrap. She cringed at the sound, a muted metallic clank that quickly faded.<br>
<br>
 She was deep beneath the Warrens. Maintenance crawlways, drainage tubes, and air vents crisscrossed the rock, but even at this depth larger tunnels were still being discovered.<br>
<br>
 With effort she freed the hatch and swung it open. Immediately her vizhelm registered a light source, she flicked off the IR broadcast in her HUD and waited for her eyes to adjust. Phosphorescence spilled from the hatchway, a cobalt green that made her think of blacklight.<br>
<br>
 She fixed her grapmag to an iron girder and lowered herself into the tunnel. It was full-sized, 4 meters of line unwound to reach the base. Alma unclipped the winch from her belt and left it hanging.<br>
<br>
 Faint light surrounded her. She guessed lichen would be the source, or a deep-dwelling fungus, but the light shifted somewhat, pulsated, and when she knelt for a closer look she saw that it came from grubs. Thousands of luminescent grubs meandered along the walls, feeding on regular streaks of what looked to be heavy black paste.<br>
<br>
 There were no train tracks in the tunnel, which was odd. Alma enabled mapping and continued on. There was an acrid smell, not rot exactly, but sour. She much preferred the dry, old smell of the Warrens.<br>
<br>
 After a time the paste on the walls disappeared, the grubs thinned out and the light dimmed. Alma tread on quietly, her eyes had adjusted and she did not want to spoil the walk with the HUD. But as she ventured further the dark in the tunnel became thick. Her breathing went shallow, she felt pressed in upon, and even her rabbit eyes could see nothing.<br>
<br>
 Just at that time she entered a place of dangerous silence, a watchful quiet, that is the sound of several quiets overlapping.<br>
<br>
âYouâre in Mole Land,â said a gravely voice. âAnd should not be.â<br><br>

<br>
 Nova changes you. After a year or two your pupils lose their color and your mind sharpens for tiny details, picking out shadows that lie at fractionally wrong angles, light misplaced by minutes from its proper channel in the day, the glint of platinum as opposed to gold.<br>
<br>
 But in meat life you may miss important stimuli. Like a truck. Or a long flight of stairs. Or the difference between a crow and a gun.<br>
<br>
 The distinction sharpens as your novatime piles up. Addiction is the first phase, but everyone past 2052 is addicted. When your body changes, when your mind begins to shake its confines and stretch out within its preferred domain, when implants become a real considerationâfaster uploads, faster reflexes, sharper visionâthatâs when the choice kicks in.<br>
<br>
 We call it going alien. And the ones who plug up, the ones who upload memories and movement centers to nova: We call them aliens.<br>
<br>
 Every population has them, those who have given up much to move a little closer to the singularity. In meat life they are removed, docile, and rarely met. But in nova you will know them. They see you from 10000 meters. They see you through walls. However fast, however strong, however skilled you are, it is laughable. Some of them can fly. And so we call them gods.<br>
<br>
 From the Dead Rabbit clan, there have come six Alien Rabbit Gods.<br>
<br>
 To consecrate these warrens, we intone their names.<br><br></div><br></div>

	<div grid-col="9" grid-pad="3" class=""><div style="text-align: left">Bernal Tesseract stroked his whiskers and stared again at the sec-screen. It was old, circa 2050s, manufactured during a period when the retro green of the MS-DOS display had come back into vogue.<br>
<br>
 It flashed the same code at him in rotation, maddeningly, again and again, across its curved monitor. It looked like M1T7R1Lhex, a basic security language that every rabbit learned as a kit. But each attempt he made to crack it from that framework failedâ¦and he was getting cold.<br>
<br>
 Beyond the locked door somewhere, his Berliner comrades were holed up in warm tunnels, jacked into nova or gathered around a fire barrel, chewing braided grass.<br>
<br>
 He had begun to shiver, and to give up hope of breaking the entrance code. He remembered a pile of old boxes he had passed earlier and was debating whether he could fashion them into a warm bed when it struck him: The code was not M1T7R1Lhex at all. It looked similar, but its principles, though equally simple, were entirely different.<br>
<br>
 Suddenly the voice of Wilhelm Tesseract rang in his mind:<br>
<br>
 <i>Rabbits, when facing a problem, one must first determine what sort of problem it is. You cannot know the rules of a game before understanding which game is being played.</i><br>
<br>
 Bernal smiled. He looked at the code once more, pressed a few buttons, and the door clicked open.</div></div>

 The jump from London to New York has been established.<br>
<br>
The grey dirge had been sung for Bernal Tesseract, and his bedding scattered before we heard him calling from the Wet Tunnels. A rope was lowered and we pulled him up, filthy and smiling.<br>
<br>
 He looked good, for a young rabbit presumed lost to rockdeath.<br>
<br>
 âGlad I ended up back here with you lot,â he said, grinning. âDidnât know where I was. But once I felt the water I was pretty sure I wasnât dead.â<br>
<br>
 The clan gathered around him, sniffing.<br>
<br>
 âIâve been elsewhere,â he said. âAnd not just in time. Iâve had a visit with our comrades in New York. Leastwise, the ones who went back for the Straw Hat Riot of â22. A good time that was, snatching hats off heads, or else wearing them, and outrunning the mob. And let me say, City Hall Station looks grand, lit by electric chandelier.â<br>
<br>
 We all wanted to know how he did it, of course.<br>
<br>
 âItâs like a normal jump,â he said, âbut foggier. Youâve got to let yourself drift. Thereâs a cold spark, like the fear that comes from leaping over water, that one must give in to. Afterward, when you feel the pull, head toward it. It calls to you, bright, like the HUD on a vizhelm, and the trick is to not think much about it.â<br>
<br>
 This only made the clan more curious and it was not long until the jump over the Atlantic had become commonplace.</div><br></div>

And we found it in the abandoned subway tubes beneath the street. Networks of tunnels, and empty stations, their stairways bricked up, their tiled walls still plastered with moldering ink-press posters.<br>
<br>
 Slowly we have made the place our own. Power we pirated from the street. Weeks were spent clearing the rubbish of another age, colored bottles, sturdy metal cans, and bag upon bag of cast-off ticket stubs. The upper levels we opened to topsiders, those who wander down in search of privacy, or adventure, or a refuge from the rain.<br>
<br>
 But the deepest sections we keep only for our own. A heavy metal door stands guard. A flight of iron stairs spirals down. This is where the clan meets. Where we make our jumps, traveling back as far as we dare. Its name is called the Dead Warrens.<br>

 Our clan have always been scavengers. We moved from place to place, scrounging used parts and cast-off clothes, camping in old subway tunnels and in the basements of abandoned factories. But as Wilhelmâs ability spread throughout the clan, time jumping became our new way of life.<br>
<br>
 We jump back to uncover secrets, play tricks, and hide clues about the future. And sometimes we indulge ourselves, exploring your best vintage years to collect 80s shades, concert tees, and Atari 2600s.<br>
