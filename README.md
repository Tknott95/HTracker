# hZics
hZics, the haskell tracker


- This can be used to monitor website activity and extended to tell you wha exactly has changed 
- This has the ability to send you a text message you every time a change occurs
- This was coded quickly to handle a usecase. This code still needs to be cleaned.  
- Currently I am open sourcing some older code so it will be a while before I clean this repository or extend it further. 
- I have a few different haskell repositories similar to this one that will slowly emerge. 

` mapConcurrently is better than nesting concurrently. I will clean this code another time.`
